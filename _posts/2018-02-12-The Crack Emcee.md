The following is an interview with  **Mr. Louis Troy Dixon aka The Crack Emcee**. He's a stupendous and luminary artist from California. He has worked with many renowned musicians and successful people. 

I knew I would start playing Music in 1966. I heard a song called "B A B Y" - "Baby", by - Carla Thomas.
Her Father was a Major Star when I was a child. This song attracted my ear, you know when people hear a song, people will start singing its like they say something and they come to the chorus "Oooh I Love You", and then there's the Middle Ace, the part in the middle of the song where there's music, the instrumentalists play somehting, it's usually 8 Bars long and that's why it's called the Middle Ace, after hearing the Middle Ace of this song "Baby", it just got my ear and i just thought that i was the most magical thing I'd ever heard and I knew from here that, this was something I was gonna get involved in my entire Life; I just knew it, I was consumed by it and to this day I can hear that song and i will be transported right back to the place where I first heard it. Now there's a movie out now called "Baby Driver" and the song's featured in this movie and I thought that it's the most amazing thing that they pulled into the movie and they treated as it's a very special song so it holds a special place in the movie too. I thought that was very significant for me too when I was watching that movie, I thought whoever put that song in the movie .... he gets it, understands where its coming from.


## Q2. Which famous musicians did you admire?
--> 	I admired my Father, my Stepfather and their Friends, but they all played Jazz and I thought as a child that Jazz was music for Adults, not old folks music but Adults so I didn't think I would be playing Jazz. When i became an Adult, then playing Jazz became very important to me.
Q. So it didn't Excite you?
-->	Not in a way that Pop did, or Rock, you know I thought Rock was Fascinating and I thought Pop made me Happy, But Jazz thought about things that were very Sublime and those are weird emotions for Children to process, you its about people cheating on each other and things like that. These are strange emotions for children. There's a song by Nina Simone - "Don't Explain", when I was a Child i thought it was one of the most haunting sound song I've ever heard. It's a song about a women who knows her lover is cheating on her and he comes home and all she says is "Don't Explain" I recommend listening to that song because you'll understand that if you are a baby or a child thats 5 - 6 years old, you don't know what to do with this song. But i had to as its was the thing I was exposed to but it payed me off later when i started playing music, now I'm an expert in transporting those kinds of feelings to other people.


## Q3.When did you start playing actual instruments?
-->	I see myself as a Recording Artist more than a Musician or Producer would be a better term. If you are Producer you get more fascinated by a studio that records things than instruments. I can take out my Tape recorder and go out recording the city, animals, musicians and then use them. So my ears here became more important, people still tell me i've got Golden Ears because i can hear what people can't. If a musicians has a song and it's not working then I can  make it work. I started playing when I was a child, my Father had Drums, and other instruments and I would mess around with them but pretty soon i lost interest in it because i thought i wouldn't be as good as other people and part of it because i preferred listening than playing instruments. Then Rap came, any body can make a Rap its not a Musicians thing it's a Producer's thing. 

## Q. Did you have any friends that were like you?
-->	Yeah, I remember 1 guy, this is a sad story. His name was Reggie, when Prince became very popular, he (Reggie) spoke to a lot of Black People who were different. He played Guitar he was in Georgia and he came to California and we started hanging out with each other all the time we knew we were going to play music together, but he had to go back to Georgia to take care of some things before we could make our Band. Then he came back to Cali and called me from the Airport and he said "I'm here, we are gonna do this" he was very excited. But he never made it Home, he got killed before he made it back from the Airport. South Central Los Angeles where i grew up is not a nice place, the people just killed him for money, his guitar, and it was a big turning point for my life I was sure that he and I were gonna do great things and I almost didn't recover from it.


## Q4. How do you handle mistakes during a performance and how do you handle the nervousness ?
-->	Well, I never handle it well..., it's always embarrassing. You are standing in front of sometimes thousands of people and you forget the words and the worst thing that happened was I broke 2 Fingers on stage I was in Canada, I broke both middle fingers on my hands, its difficult to explain, lets just say I smashed them at the same time and 1 of them is still crooked if you look at it. Blood was flying everywhere and i wore all white that night, because i was so pumped up at the performance that i didn't even notice it but the audience could see it, the only ay I came to know about it wad by looking at the audience, they were all watching me with a look of horror. Then I looked down and knew that i had blood all over so got off stage and rushed to the hospital. My band was called Beat Nigs.


## Q5. How often or how long do you practice?
-->	When I'm doing a Band I practice,  for about 2 Months, it usually takes 2 Months for a group for me, other people do it differently so I think my stuff's better than those people, 2 months is long enough for them to know the songs, feel comfortable with it, I get everybody together for twice a week and we rehearse atleast for 4 - 8 hours each time, to get really good it requires practice, you do it until you are just sick of them, humming them(songs) in your sleep	and when you are finished you can play them backwards. When the artists get bored with the songs, they become creative they start to play with it and thats whn the magic happens. The 1st week they are just learning the song, 2nd week they are becoming good at it, 3rd week they are bored with it, but the 4th week or the last month, thats when the magic happens, they start adding their own personality to the song, thats when their contribution kicks in to what you wrote.


## Q6.What is your favourite childhood memory?
-->	Being in Texas and eating fried Catfish. I remember sitting with my family  and this had to be like 1968 or 1969 maybe and I wasn't that old I was really young. Eating Catfish I don't know why but it was the best thing i've ever tasted and I still remember that moment because my mother she made everybody stop and look at me as I was just so Happy and I was a little kid and I was bouncing as I ate. That was the best childhood memory next to finding "B A B Y, Baby".


## Q7.How did the cultural issues impact you back then?
-->	Back then was very different then now, back then Black people had to get off the side walk when they encountered white people, they didn't mix very much back then. It was such a different world. Theres a movie called "Oh Brother, Where art thou?" with George Clooney, that movie gives you a feeling waht life was like in the past . But now that I'm getting older I think, back then that era was a trick but that's how it felt, that movie captures it very very well. Life was harder, in America there was a lot of Racism so, to travel to Texas for instance from Cali, you (Black People) couldn't just travel, you had to plan everything, you had to be careful to travel across America if you were Black in the past and I remember not being able to just do waht you want. It was terrifying travelling across the country, if you were driving and you came across some white people you had to get behind them on the road you couldn't drive past them. I dont think the things totally changed untill the 70's, it was then when they started to change and they changed a lot. 
I'm not a follower, a joiner I never follow the crowd, I look at everybody kind of sideways I'm  more amused watching other people doing foolish things than wanting to join in. I thank the counter culture for that because I got to know these things early. 


## Q8.What was good in that time and bad today?
-->	You are more innocent in the past, that always makes the past better than it was, you don't know what you don't know. Today I know so much, there are terrible things happening while we talk, I'm always aware of it, I will always know there's evil in the world, there are terrible people and there's no escaping it, today I know things, thats the difference between then and now. It's no longer me, its me and you and everybody else.


## Q9.What did you do for a living along with music?
-->	Once I started Beatnigs, once I started playing music professionally I didn't do anything else but before that I was in sale, I sold Yamaha Scooters, Scooters just had come to the US, we thought scooters were things only people in Italy rode, they came to the US and I thought they were pretty cool I got a job selling them and I was also working at a Cafe, those were the 2 jobs I had when my Band took off.

## Q. So getting a job back then was easy? like you didn't require a college degree ?
-->	No, I mean most jobs don't require a college degree, sales don't require it, you should have a quick mouth and a quick mind, sales require you to talk till today, if you can talk you can sell and you don't even have to know what you are selling. After I stopped playing music for a while, I went bak to sales I started selling cars.

## Q10. What was the year when you stopped playing professionally?
-->	Around 2007, I mean I still make a song now and then, but I don't have a recording contract now and I don't have a Band and so I don't play very often now and after I started selling cars. I don't know anything about cars. Sales require that they(people) trust you(salesman) and I can get people to trust me I'm a trustworthy guy so it wasn't necessary for me to know cars, it was necessary for me to know ME. Car salesman usually have a bad reputation, they are known as shifty guys crooked guys, so finding a car salesman to trust is a big thing and I sold a car on my very first day of work which everybody thought was amazing. I was new in that state Utah and I had never been to Utah before. I moved in with my friend and the next day he drove me around so that I can see what jobs were available and I saw a sign at a car dealership saying ''We are hiring'' and so I walked in I talked to the guy and said I used to sell scooters a long time ago and he said ''If you can sell scooters, you can sell cars''. The next day I came in, the customers came in he said ''Go get' em'' and I got'm, he was shocked I was shocked everybody was shocked. I sold cars till I was sick of the car business, I never got sick of selling cars, I got sick of the car business, its nasty, its evil. I sold Cadillacs, Trucks, very expensive cars, cheap cars, used cars, new cars. When you sell cars for 5 years you sell a lot of cars, the best part about car sales is that if you are good at it, you can use any car that they have for yourself because they want their best salesman to look good, you pick one car and thats you car and you can drive and I loved that I was driving around in some very nice cars. I like the Ford Fusion, some of the Subarus, I pick cars based on the sound system I like long drives I can drive for days without any problems as long as I have some good music good stereo, to me thats heaven I just love it usually I would go with 2 friends.

## Q. When did you stop selling cars ?
-->	I stopped selling cars in like 2012.


## Q11. So what do you do now?
-->	Now I'm just driving, I'm not involved in music or anything, I got divorced and thats the major thing I was married for 20 years and when that came to an end I was shattered. I was a foster child so making a family was very important to me so when I lost that I didn't even know I would live so I stopped doing anything I almost stopped living, whether I will be back into music I don't even know the friends I used to be with have moved away started their own family, I don't even know whether I want to do anything now. Being a Musician an Artist was my Big Dream, having a family was my dream. I am at a point where i think that its still possible, maybe 1 day I'll fall in love have a wife and kids if she's young enough, but it's not likely as I'm a different person now its still possible but losing that dream changed things dramatically. Now I'm trying to write 3 books but the hard part is I've never been a writer before I never thought myself as a writer I don't even know if I CAN write I can write songs as a monster but writing a book I don't know I don't feel confident about that as i feel for other things. I can sell books without knowing whats inside but writing that, I don't know. If I had a ghost writer, then it might be possible because I have billions of stories.


## Q12. What got you started thinking as an entrepreneur?
-->	Music propelled me into worlds that I never thought I would go into, I started being drawn to different things I'd never done before, I was once a model for Bank of America, music would just take you places. Then computers came along and that changed everything and everybody in Cali thought that they were gonna be Millionaires. 


## Q13. What are the best and worst purchases you've ever made ?
-->	I'd say both of them are "Wife", you would say you couldn't purchase a wife, but you know its not being married that wrecked my life but not losing my music career, it makes me feel sad, it makes me feel as if I'm not living my life to my full potential, that kind of a feeling. Loosing my wife, family makes me feel as if I want to die sometimes.
